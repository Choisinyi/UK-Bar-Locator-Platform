# Business Objectives
With people across the UK itching to get out from lockdown as a result of Covid-19 and understanding that pubs plays a significant role in English culture, this streamlit app is designed to recommend and help you find bars near you. By doing so, we hope to achieve the following:

- Help customers find new pubs
- Help local pubs find new potential customers
- Assist tourist that might be unfamiliar with the area looking to visit a pub
