# Business Objectives
With people across the UK itching to get out from lockdown as a result of Covid-19 and understanding that pubs plays a significant role in English culture, this streamlit app is designed to recommend and help you find bars near you. By doing so, we hope to achieve the following:

- Help customers find new pubs
- Help local pubs find new potential customers
- Assist tourist that might be unfamiliar with the area looking to visit a pub

# Part A: AI Chatbot
Mainly using the Google dialogflow to build the AI Chatbot

Intents:
- 1. Suggest different types of pubs and drinks -> Result from Google 
- 2. Connect to Google Canledar API -> 
- 3. Ask for the nearest pubs-> Recommendation System -> Streamlit (Part B)
